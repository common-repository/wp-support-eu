= WordPress Support. European Standards =
Whenever you need help with your WordPress powered website, you just ask a question from your own admin dashboard.
A small army of coders are waiting to prove themselves by giving you the right answer and solving your problem.
Good news: IT'S FREE!

= Get involved =

WordPress developers can contribute by answering questions on [WPSupport.EU website](http://wpsupport.eu).

== Installation ==
= Required =
You need an account on WPSupport.EU
If you don't have one, request an invite [here](http://wpsupport.eu). It's FREE!

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. 
To do an automatic install of WordPress Support plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WordPress Support by WPSupport.EU” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Activation =
The first time you use the widget, you need to enter the email address you have signed up with and also the app_key. After the first succesful login, these details will be stored inside your database and the plugin will login automatically.

You can always find your app_key inside your account on [WPSupport.EU](http://wpsupport.eu)


= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
